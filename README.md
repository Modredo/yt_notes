# YT video knowledge extraction

# WIP #

Often when watching a video you learn new fact or hear about an interesting resource, research paper. You do not note it down and even if you remember which vide or which channel had this piece of information it is quite hard and time consuming to try and find what may be just a couple of sentences. That makes recalling and re linking information hard. Its a lost opportunity and with multiple such instances, its becomes a bad habit to just give up easily. 

This project is meant to help remedying such situations.
